                        " While Software Development is a huge passion of mine, it doesn‚Äôt even begin to compare to how important my faith and family are in my life. My love and friend Tarie and my four siblings (Vig, Vitu, Vin and Vision), Dad and Mum, they are my entire world and I thank God for them every day ! "</p>

                    </h2>
                    <p> My path as a web and software developer has revolved around one thing:
                        staying passionate about what I‚Äôm doing. I‚Äôve been taking development as a career since 2014.

                        These days I spend my time pursuing my passion of developing for clients and sharing
                        with others all that I‚Äôve learned. I started offering workshops at some pretty
                        incredible locations around the world and I cannot wait to see where we end up next!

                        <span>Growing up in Zimbabwe</span>
                    </h2>
                    I grew up in Zimbabwe and still live here today. I graduated high school back in 2013 and made it for
                        four years into university before securing my first job at Sandvik Mining and Construction Company.
                        Later l changed my job to join FBC Holdings Bank: a bank which l had worked with during my internship
                        back in 2016. I realized it was going to benefit me a lot to work in the banking industry,
                        I said ‚Äúlet me get on with it‚Äù and until now l am still working at FBC Holdings Bank,
                        It‚Äôs a decision I haven‚Äôt regretted for a single second.<br/>
                        I consider myself a rather bad Zimbabwean. Don‚Äôt get me wrong,
                        I get somewhat annoyed when people talk about how Zimbabwe is the most beautiful place on Earth.
                        It‚Äôs not (please don‚Äôt send me hate mail for that, fellow Zimbabweans).
                        The things that keeps me here are my family (both sides of the family are here),
                        the freedoms we have here that other countries simply do not, the morality,
                        and occasionally the weather (mainly storm season).</p>

                    </h2>
                    <p> I am a blessed man, and I try to remember that as much as possible. We‚Äôre all blessed in different ways
                        but I lucked out in a few areas and I do my best not to take that for granted. I have an absolutely incredible and
                        beautiful girlfriend, mum, dad and my four siblings. They are the love of my life and I seriously cannot believe they
                        put up with me on a daily basis :-). I anticipate to work from home as a web and software developer.
                        I‚Äôm so happy to be able to work a bit close to my family although it‚Äôs taken a lot of work and dedication
                        to make this possible, l wouldn‚Äôt trade it for the world. And I mean that quite literally. I am also fortunate
                        to have most of my other family living close as well and l spend a lot of time with them and love them all dearly.</p>

                        <h5>  Web and Software Development: </h5>
                            <p>I know this seems obvious, but it really is my main passion. Software has always helped me to see clearer,
                            to save life and capture the beauty that is all around us in the management of complexity and
                                creation of solutions (that we so often overlook).</p>

                        <h5>Reading/Learning:</h5>
                            <p>I love to read, whether with a traditional book or listening to books through Audible.
                                I enjoy mostly nonfiction, choosing books that will teach me something I didn‚Äôt know before
                                or something I want to learn more about. The bible is the top one in my favourite books list!</p>
                        <h5>Traveling:</h5>
                            <p>I will never understand people that don‚Äôt travel. I don‚Äôt think less of them or anything like that,
                                I just don‚Äôt understand it. The world (as Discovery Channel would say) is just awesome.
                        <h5>Spending time doing stuff besides work:</h5>
                             <p>I don‚Äôt want to spend the best years of my
                                life working 40-80 hours a week so that I can relax and enjoy life when I‚Äôm on hospice.
                                Tomorrow is never guaranteed so there‚Äôs no time like right now to get out there and experience the world.
                                This will prove to be a very lengthy conversation piece should you ever sit down with me for coffee,
                                dinner or a drink.</p>
